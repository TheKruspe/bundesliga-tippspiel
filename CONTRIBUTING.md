## Copyright and Management

The original author, Hermann Krumrey, has the absolute authority on the management
of this project and may steer the development process as he sees fit.

Contributions will be attributed to the author of said code and the copyright will
remain the author's.

## Coding guidelines

**Style**

We feel that a unified coding style is important, which is why we require a linter to
be used. In this case **phpCheckStyle** is used. Code must pass the tests specified.

**Documentation**

The website should be documented somewhat, though that is currently not really the case.

At the very least, javadoc-style comment should be used.
